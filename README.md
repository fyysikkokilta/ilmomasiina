# Ilmomasiina

Ilmomasiina is the event registration system originally created by Athene, forked by Tietokilta and currently under
heavy development for our new site. Once finished, it will be available for all organizations to use, along with
migration tools from the Athene-made version.

The latest reviewed development version is in the `dev` branch.

**Please note that the code is currently in alpha phase and may still have bugs.**
Major features for 2.0 are mostly done and we expect to reach beta in spring 2024.

## Installation

Progress and planning is tracked in GitHub issues.
