# Ilmomasiina

Ilmomasiina is the event registration system originally created by Athene in 2016,
and forked in 2021 by Tietokilta for our new website.
There are [numerous major upgrades](./CHANGELOG.md) from the Athene version.

Ilmomasiina is easy to [install](docs/installation.md) in various environments and
is freely available for all organizations to use.
[Migrating](docs/migration.md) from the Athene-made version is also supported.

Releases are made as Git tags and follow semantic versioning. The current stable version is in the `2.x` branch,
while the latest development version is in the `dev` branch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `dev` branch is currently used for major changes upcoming to Ilmomasiina 3.0. Significant instability and
> breaking changes are expected. If you maintain a fork of Ilmomasiina, we **strongly recommend** tracking `2.x` until
> 3.0 is more stable.
>
> We expect to release a version of Ilmomasiina 2.x in 2026 that will allow making most customizations from the UI,
> removing the need for most users to fork Ilmomasiina.
